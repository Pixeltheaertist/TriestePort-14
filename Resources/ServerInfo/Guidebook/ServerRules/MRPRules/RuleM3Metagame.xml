  # Do not metagame

  Metagaming is the act of using out of character information that a character would have no way of knowing.
  You must have an In-Character justification for information used during a round. The Marshal has no reason to expect Syndicate agents are on the platform during code green. The bartender does not know a hyper-effecient TEG setup.

  # New Life Rule (NLR)

  Your character does not remember anything from when they were in critical condition, learnt during death or learnt in the approximately ~5 minutes leading up to their death

  If you are cloned or borged, you instead do not remember anything from the start of the shift

  ## Examples

 Acceptable:
  - The bartender who medbay just revived remembering the janitor they made friends with at the start of the shift
  - The detective finding holographic fibers on a door, and proceeding to check suspects for chameleon gloves

  Not Acceptable:
  - The bartender who was revived in medbay immediatly reporting the clown to security for murdering them
  - The bartender who was cloned saying the clown was 'acting suspiciously' earlier in the shift
  - The Marshal only finding two thiefs 40 minutes into the shift, and calling Code Red as 'it must be cascade operatives'
  - Using low-effort roleplay to skirt the metashield.
