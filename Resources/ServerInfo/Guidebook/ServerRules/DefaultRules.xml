  # Trieste Port Rules
  Trieste Port is an MRP server, meaning that some level of roleplay is required.

  [color=#ff0000]By joining the round, admins will assume you have read the rules regardless of your actions ingame.[/color]

   ex:-'I didn't read the rules' is NOT a viable excuse.

  ## Core Rules
  These rules apply at all times, including between rounds.

  -  Admins have final say over a situation
  -  Don't be a dick
  -  No Hate Speech or Discriminatory Language
       >this includes specieism
  -  No sexual content/themes, including erotic roleplay (ERP) and no shock content. You will be banned without hesitation.
  -  Do not use out of game methods to communicate with other players in the same round.
      >this includes things such as being on a discord call

  -  Do not use multiple accounts, or alt accounts, and do not share accounts
  -  Do not overly spam or ignore admin messages

  -  Players must be and act at least 16 years old
  -  Use realistic character names. Names of famous people or characters are not allowed.

  ## Roleplay Rules
  These rules only apply during a round. A round ends only when the game returns to the lobby. [color=#ff0000]All of these rules apply fully whenever the game is not at the lobby unless it is in an exempt game mode.[/color]

  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.

  ## Silicon Rules
  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, these Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules.
